# Agenda
## The main topics discussed were:
* Current workflow and process steps
* Prioritizing accuracy over coverage/productivity
* Rule-based modules vs. AI modules
* Data needs and constraints
* Development status and pipeline planning

## Decisions Made
* Focus initially will be on automating the preprocessing steps using rule-based scripts. This will filter out items before feeding into the AI models.
* AI models will start with common attributes like brand, model number etc. across categories. Category-specific attributes can be added later.
* Model outputs will be matching types like exact match, partial match etc. rather than confidence scores.
* Even low coverage, but high accuracy subsets would provide value.

## Action Items
* Document current workflow end-to-end with details on automation status.
* Onboard operations resource to provide input to tech team.
* Setup governance model and tracking for progress.

## Key Discussion Highlights
* Maximizing accuracy of outputs is the priority rather than improving productivity. This aligns to business goals.
* Multi-phase approach proposed with rule-based models followed by AI models.
* Need tight collaboration between ops and tech teams for this program.

## Next Steps
* Complete workflow documentation.
* Develop project plan and timeline.
* Continue experiments on AI models.
* Setup periodic syncs to track progress
